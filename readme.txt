Block click fraud, web scraping and other destructive actions with the most effective web application firewall in the industry.

== Description ==
### If you're using paid search advertising, want to prevent click fraud and preserve your ad budgets, you need Bluefield Identity. 

Screen **ALL** incoming traffic to your site blocking click fraud, web scraping and other destructive actions with the most effective service in the industry. Give us a try with our 30 day free trial and see what partnering with Bluefield Identity can do for you. 

Quick and easy installation provides immediate real-time protection for ALL your siteâ€™s incoming traffic.

When we say **"risk free"** we mean mean exactly that. Install Bluefield Identity and try us for 30 days. At the end of the month you'll get an invoice and a performance report. Compare that against your own analytics and data and **YOU** decide. If you want to continue denying bad traffic that doesn't convert, pay the invoice (Bluefield Identity costs **$30USD per month for 6000 clicks and $10 for each additional 2000 clicks**) and we keep screening your site visitors and protecting your ad budgets. If not...don't pay the bill. The trial ends, we close your account and we thank you for giving us a try and you owe us nothing. 

It's that simple. No gimmicks and no strings attached. We believe in our service and will prove it to you.

Cancel anytime by simply not paying the last invoice because there are no contracts. If you choose to come back later, simply pay the unpaid invoice and we're partners again. 

#### Why is Bluefield Identity better?

* Bluefield Identity screens ALL traffic, paid and organic and we screen for **ALL paid traffic sources**, not just Google, Meta and Microsoft.  

* Bluefield Identity works on YOUR website and we don't require access to your paid ads accounts.

* Bluefield Identity allows you to refine what traffic you allow by configuring your own filters (as of September 2024, we use 17 different filters). Create geofences, set click rate limits (3 separate tiers), deny access from proxy sources and much more. Bluefield Identity is a web application firewall designed from the ground up to defeat click fraud and other malicious activity.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* Is the trial really free?
Yes.  In fact, we never ask for your credit card or bank account info. We send you an invoice each month and you pay via our payment portal. Partnership with Bluefield Identity has no contracts so you're never roped into a commitment. When you receive our monthly invoice and performance report, YOU choose whether to pay the invoice or not. If Bluefield Identity isn't right for your business, don't pay the invoice and, within a few days, we will suspend your Bluefield Identity account with no questions asked and no collection efforts. If you choose to come back later (we encourage you to see how we stack up against our competitors), simply pay the previous unpaid invoice amount and your account is reactivated automatically.

* Will your plugin slow down my site?
No. The Bluefield Identity service was designed to provide the fastest response possible (average response time = 12 milliseconds) and is hosted on the most robust cloud network available guaranteeing the quickest and shortest web trace routing possible.  While we can't guarantee transmission speeds, we do guarantee the speed of our service.
